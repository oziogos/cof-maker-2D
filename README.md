# cof-maker-2D
This python project generates two-dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) initial configurations for density functional theory (DFT) calculations using Quantum Espresso.

The current implementation can automatically generate 2D tetragonal COFs using core and linker fragments found in the 'data' directory. All relevant information on molecular fragments is included in data/fragments.py.

A basic testing capability is included and controlled via data/tests.py.

Code features are shown in the COFmaker ipynb and py files.
